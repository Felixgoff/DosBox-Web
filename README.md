# What is DOSBox?
**DOSBox** is a free and open-source emulator of an Intel x86 personal computer designed for the purpose of running software created for disk operating systems on IBM PC compatibles, primarily DOS video games. It was first released in 2002, when DOS technology was becoming obsolete. It is notable for its widespread use for running DOS games, as well as being used in commercial re-releases of those games.
